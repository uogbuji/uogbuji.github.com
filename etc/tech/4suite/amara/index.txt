<title>Uche Ogbuji: Amara XML Toolkit</title>
<![CDATA[
Amara XML toolkit is an open-source collection of Python tools for XML processing, not just tools that happen to be written in Python, but tools built from the ground up to use Python idioms and take advantage of the many advantages of Python over other programming languages.

Amara builds on 4Suite, but whereas 4Suite focuses more on literal implementation of XML standards in Python, Amara adds a much more Pythonic face to these capabilities.

Amara provides tools you can trust to conform with XML standards without losing the familiar Python feel. The current version is 1.2.0.

<!--  The development version has many performance and API improvements, but it is not quite as field-tested as the stable version. -->

The components of Amara are: 

* _Bindery_: a data binding tool (fancy way of saying it's a very Pythonic XML API)

* _Scimitar_: an implementation of the ISO Schematron schema language for XML, which converts Schematron files to Python scripts

* _domtools_: A set of tools to augment Python DOMs

* _saxtools_: A set of tools to make SAX easier to use in Python

<!--
* _Flextyper_: an implementation of Jeni Tennison's Data Type Library Language (DTLL). Supports user-defined datatypes in Python for XML processing.
-->

## Get started

Amara 1.2a2 requires [Python](http://python.org) 2.4 and [4Suite XML 1.0](http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/4Suite-XML).  The easiest way to get going is using [easy_install](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall):

    easy_install amara

easy_install will automatically take care of installing dependencies for
you.  If you prefer not to use easy_install, then grab a 4Suite-XML package and install that, then install the Amara package using the usual:

python setup.py install

Or a [Windows installer](http://livingpyxml.python-hosting.com/wiki/AmaraWinInstallers), or other method.

To report any problems, contribute, or just discuss Amara, please use the [the 4Suite mailing list](http://lists.fourthought.com/mailman/listinfo/4Suite) for now. Just make sure you mention Amara in the subject line, preferably by prefixing with "\[amara]".

## Downloads, etc.

You can either grab what you need from the [Amara FTP site](ftp://ftp.4suite.org/pub/Amara/), or from the links below.  You can also use CVS (see farther below).

There's a lot in Amara, but here are highlights: 

## Amara Bindery: XML as easy as py

Bindery turns an XML document into a tree of Python objects corresponding to the vocabulary used in the XML document, for maximum clarity. For example, the document 

    <monty>
      <python spam="eggs">What do you mean "bleh"</python>
      <python ministry="abuse">But I was looking for argument</python>
    </monty>

Becomes a data structure such that you can write: 

    binding.monty.python.spam

In order to get the value "eggs" (as a Python Unicode object) or 

    binding.monty.python[1]

In order to get the element object with the contents "But I was looking for argument". 

There are other such tools for Python, and one thing that makes Bindery unique is that it's driven by a very declarative rules-based system for binding XML to the Python data. You can register rules that are triggered by XPattern expressions specialized binding behavior. It includes XPath support and is very efficient, using SAX to generate bindings. See the [user documentation](/tech/4Suite/etc/amara-manual.html).

## Scimitar: exceptional schema language for an exceptional programming language

Scimitar is an implementation of ISO Schematron that compiles a Schematron schema into a Python validator script.  You typically use scimitar in two phases. Say you have a schematron schema schema1.stron and you want to validate multiple XML files against it, instance1.xml, instance2.xml, instance3.xml. 

First you run schema1.stron through the scimitar compiler script, scimitar.py: 

    scimitar.py schema1.sch

A file, schema1.py (same file stem with the "py" extension sunstituted), is generated in the current working directory. If you'd prefer a different location or file name, use the "-o" option. The generated file is a validator script in Python. It checks the schematron rules specified in schema1.sch. You now run the generated validator script on each XML file you wish to validate: 

    python schema1-stron.py instance1.xml

The validation report is generated on standard output by default, or you can use the "-o" option to redirect it to a file. 

The validation report is an XML external parsed entity, a format much like
a well-formed XML document, but with some restrictions relaxed.

## Amara DOM Tools: giving DOM a more Pythonic face

Amara DOM Tools features pushdom, similar to xml.dom.pulldom, but easier
to use, and a function to return an XPath location for any DOM node.

## Amara SAX Tools: SAX without the brain explosion

Tenorsax (amara.saxtools.tenorsax) is a framework for "linerarizing" SAX logic so that it flows a bit more naturally, and needs a lot less state machine wizardry. 

<!--
## Getting started

**There is only one prereqisite:**

* [Python][56] 2.3 or more recent (tested on 2.3.5 and 2.4.1) 

[4Suite 1.0b1][57] or more recent is optional.  If you have 4Suite, grab the stand alone package, otherwise grab the allinone package.
-->

## Getting the latest CVS version

If you want to check on a new feature or bug fix recently checked in before there has been a full release, grabbing Amara from CVS is probably your best bet.

First of all, if you do not have a compatible 4Suite build installed, follow the instructions for getting and installing [4Suite CVS](http://4suite.org/docs/4SuiteCVS.xml).

Then to get Amara, log in for CVS operations and then pull the package:

    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.4suite.org:/var/local/cvsroot login
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.4suite.org:/var/local/cvsroot get Amara

Then build as usual, by running:

    python setup.py install

* [Matthew Hawkins](http://www.livejournal.com/users/darthmdh/66117.html): "I forgot to mention a week or so ago, if you're doing any XML work in Python, get Amara."  [He also wrote](http://keithdevens.com/weblog/archive/2005/Aug/10/Amara#comment8148): "Goodbye ugly, crud-filled SAX/DOM parsers, hello Amara! This is a fantastic toolset; very highly recommended.  Refactoring a small library script I have to use amara culled 2k worth of (now dead) code and also made it much more readable."

* [Derek Willis](http://www.thescoop.org/archives/2005/04/29/xml-parsing-with-python/): " If I have to parse XML into a relational database, Amara is my tool of choice.... Nice and easy - the way everybody says XML should be." 

* [Tom Lazar:](http://lists.fourthought.com/pipermail/4suite/2005-April/013607.html): "i just wanted to chime in that just yesterday I had an urgent, real- world problem in where I needed to manipulate an XML Document programmatically...using Amara i hacked a python script that did the whole job in (literally) ten minutes. as I started the script I was a bit apprehensive: afterall our script would pick out certain nodes and assign new values to them (or delete them, depending) and then write it back to the file - but it all worked without a hitch. and looking at the script, you'd never think it was handling XML at all ;-)"  
[Tom also says](https://zope1.tomster.org/tomster/site/blog/archive/2005/08/10/uche) "I've been using Amara for several months now and except for some initial hickups in the early beta phase (which he cleared away at an impressive speed) it's been rock-solid for me ever since (I use the tools I wrote with Amara on a daily basis)."

* "I just ran across your Amara toolkit, and have to say, I am quite impressed! This is by far one of the best open source python projects that I have come across to date. :o)" -- Shannon Johnson
