<title>Uche Ogbuji: IBM developerWorks Tutorial Series on 4Suite</title>

[4Suite][40] is an open-source platform for XML and RDF development. It allows
users to take advantage of standard XML technologies rapidly and to develop
and integrate Web-based applications. My brother Chimezie Ogbuji and I have
written a series of tutorials on 4Suite on IBM developerWorks. This page is a
general index and resource page on these tutorials. 

The tutorials are as follows: 

* [Python and XML development using 4Suite, Part 1: PyXml][41].
* [Python and XML development using 4Suite, Part 2: 4XPath and 4XSLT][42].
* [Python and XML development using 4Suite, Part 3: 4RDF][43].
* [Develop Python/XML with 4Suite, Part 4: Composition and updates][44].
* [Part 5: The Repository Features][45].

All require free registration on the IBM developerWorks site. Updates are
available on this tutorial below. 

## Part 5: The Repository Features

The document definition for XSA really only works for files with a single
product and vendor. For simplicity I did not cover the more general XSLT
document definitions. If these are used, the one product/one vendor
restriction is easily eliminated.

The utility namespace mapping scripts do not work properly in recent builds of
4Suite because they do not account for the "ftss://" URI scheme for 4Suite
repository objects. Use the versions hosted here rather than those that came
with the tutorial: [create-nsmapping-file.py][46] establishes a mapping file
for the user who invokes it. [add-nsmapping-file.py][47] adds a
prefix/namespace URI pair to the mapping. Both are updated 7 November 2003.
