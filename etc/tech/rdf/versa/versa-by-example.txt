Versa by example
================

This document is [on-line](http://uche.ogbuji.net/tech/rdf/versa/versa-by-example).  You can [download](http://uche.ogbuji.net/tech/rdf/versa/etc/versa-by-example.zip) the entire packet of this tutorial, which includes support files (graph images of the sample models, query files, etc.).

I will be using the Versa implementation in 4suite 1.0a1 to run the examples.
There are also notations sprinkled into the article that allow me to
extract test cases from the article.  For example, a line starting with
"@@NS" sets up a namespace mapping.  "@@SOURCE" sets up the current source RDF
document for testing. "@@QUERY" sets up a test query.  "@@EXPECTED" sets up
the expected result for the preceding test query, expressed in the XML
mapping to the for Versa data model.  The latter three can involve
listings with multiple lines, and so use the explicit terminator "@@"


##Lessons 1-20

Let us start with wordnet.rdf an example based on the WordNet model from `http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Web`, updated so that no default namespaces are used.  See wordnet.jpg in the download packet for a graph view.

###Lesson 1

First of all I can get all the resources in the model, using the all()
function.  Using 4versa, this would look like:

all() does not return literal objects, but it does return
predicates.  Technically, the underlying RDF implementation determines
what is considered to be a resource for Versa purposes, but any compliant.
RDF processor would return the above as all the known resources specified in
wordnet.rdf, according to standard RDF 1.0 rules.  The support and presence
of RDF schemata, could, of course, change what objects are considered
resources and literals based on applicable declarations.


###Lesson 2

Let us get the label of all resources that have one.  We'll do this using
a traversal expression, 

    all()-rdfs:label->*

rdfs:label is a resource.  Versa allows you to express resources in an
abbreviated form that should be familiar to RDF users: the URI of the
resource is broken into two parts, and the first part is mapped to a
namespace prefix, in this case "rdfs".  The abbreviation form consists
of the namespace prefix and the latter part of the URI joined by a colon.
This is similar to a "QName" from XML.

I use the namespace mappings expressed in the source document:

    @@NS wn -> http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/
    @@NS rdf -> http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
    @@NS rdfs -> http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#

Traversal expressions are a core feature of Versa.  They allow you to
match patterns in the model, by analogy to their structure as directed
graphs.  The above traversal expression is a forward traversal expession,
with an expression that yields a set of subjects, one that yields a
set of predicates.  A set of statements is gathered: all statements whose
subject is in the subject set and whose predicate is in the predicate set.
The last expression acts as a filter, taking the object from each statement
set, and using it as the context for evaluation.  If the result of this
evaluation is boolean true (after any necessary conversions), the object
is added to the result set.

To reiterate: this means that the result set comes from the *objects* of
statements matching the traversal expression.

I only specify a single resource for the predicate (rdfs:label), but
this is OK, as it is converted to a Set of length 1 automatically by
Versa.

    $ 4versa --rdf-file=wordnet.rdf "all()-rdfs:label->*"

From now on we'll display the results without reference to the
4versa command line.  You should expect the same structure of
results from any Versa engine, although they may not be presented
in the same XML form as 4versa uses, or they may not be in XML at all.


###Lesson 3

I can make my criteria more sophisticated.  For instance, to get
only values whose label is "Web [ 1 ]", I can replace the catch-all
"*" with an equality check:

    @@QUERY
    all() - rdfs:label -> eq("Web [ 1 ]")
    @@

    @@EXPECTED
    <List>
      <String>Web [ 1 ]</String>
    </List>
    @@


If I want all values whose label contains the string "je", I can use

    @@QUERY
    all() - rdfs:label -> contains("je")
    @@

    @@EXPECTED
    <List>
      <String>Object [ 1 ]</String>
      <String>Physical_object [ 1 ]</String>
    </List>
    @@

Of course, in such cases, what I usually want are the resource that
are subjects of matching statements rather than the objects.  See
lesson 9 for how to retrieve the subjects instead.


###Lesson 4

But actually, the above will get the label of all all resources in the model
that have one.  If I want to restrict it to resource of type rdfs:Class
that have labels, I could write

    @@QUERY
    (rdfs:Class <- rdf:type - *) - rdfs:label -> *
    @@

This uses a chained traversal expression, one backward, and one forward.
Let's take a quick look at the backward traversal:

    rdfs:Class <- rdf:type - *

This is similar to the forward traversal, but it starts with a set of
objects.  The second expression is a set of predicates, and the third
is still a filtering expression that is evaluated on all the partial
results of statements matching the subject and predicate set.  The filter
is applied with each subject as context, and if true, the subject is added
to the result set.

So if you can think of the forward traversal as moving along the specified
arcs from subjects to objects, and then filtering the result, think of
a backward traversal as moving *against* the specified predicates from
objects to subjects, and then filtering the subjects.

The result of the first traversal becomes the subject set of the second one.

It will help to make this process clear if you follow this movement
on the graph of my sample model.

Result:

    @@EXPECTED
    <List>
      <String>Web [ 1 ]</String>
      <String>Physical_object [ 1 ]</String>
      <String>Object [ 1 ]</String>
    </List>
    @@


###Lesson 5

Because type checks are so common in query, Versa has a short cut, the type function.  The following is the same as the above query

    @@QUERY
    type(rdfs:Class) - rdfs:label -> *
    @@

Result:

    @@EXPECTED

    </List>
    @@


###Lesson 6

But what if I want to do the same thing, but I want the label *and* the description?  I can retrieve the list of resources of interest, and then use the
distribute function to compute subexpressions over each:

    @@QUERY
    distribute(type(rdfs:Class), ".- rdfs:label->*", ".-rdfs:description->*")
    @@

The distribute function takes 2 or more aruments.  The result of the first
argument is converted to a list (the source list).  Each item in the list
is take in turn, and treated as context.  The second and following arguments
are each converted to a string, which is parsed as a Versa sub-query
(a dynamic expression) and evaluated with this context.  The result
of the distribute function is a list of lists.  The outer list is as
long as the list given by the first argument.  Each inner list contains
the results of evaluating each item in the initial list against
the dynamic expressions.

Result:

Notice the empty sets.  This is because not all of the resources have labels or descriptions.  The empty sets act as placeholders for this.


###Lesson 7

If the empty sets are a nuisance, I could explicitly exclude resources that don't have a label, using the filter function:

@@QUERY
distribute(filter(type(rdfs:Class), ".- rdfs:label->*"), ".- rdfs:label->*", ".-rdfs:description->*")
@@

The filter function takes 2 or more arguments.  The first one is converted
to a list (the source list).  Each item in this list is used as the context
in evaluating the dynamic expressions given by the second and subsequent
arguments.  The result of each dynamic expression is converted to boolean
and the result is a list of each item from the source list that produces
a true result when applied against all the dynamic expression.

###Lesson 8

I can easily look up a particular resource, using a traversal expression.
Let us get the description of one of the resources:

    @@QUERY
    @"http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Object" - rdfs:description -> *
    @@

One can't always use an abbreviated resource literal.  Versa allows
you to spell out the entire URL of the resource:
@"http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Object".  The part between the quotes
must be a valid URI, and the literal represents the resource with that URI.
In this case, I could also have used an abbreviated form, such as wn:Object.

Result:

    @@EXPECTED
    <List>
      <String>a physical (tangible and visible) entity; "it was full of rackets, balls and other objects"</String>

    @@


###Lesson 9

So far I have obtained the objects of statements in traversal expressions,
but often what I want are the subjects of matching statements.  Versa provides
filter expressions, which are similar to traversal expressions, but which
return subjects rather than objects.

For example, to get all resources with a label of "Web [ 1 ]", I can use
the following:

    @@QUERY
    all() |- rdfs:label -> eq("Web [ 1 ]")
    @@

Result:

    @@EXPECTED
    <List>
      <Resource>http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Web</Resource>
    </List>
    @@

The operation of this expressions is almost exactly like the similar
forward traversal from lesson 3, but rather than returning the object,
it returns the subject.

Similarly, to get all resources whose label contains the label "je"

    @@QUERY
    all() |- rdfs:label -> contains("je")
    @@

###Lesson 10

In lesson 1, a simple "all()" returned all resources, including predicates.

###Lesson 24

I can also traverse properties transitively.  In for instance, if I wanted
to get all ancestors of Uche Ogbuji, I need to transitively traverse
father and mother relationships.  I can do so using a special long-hand
form of the traversal expression: the traverse function.  Notably, this
function also allows us to specify arguments, including the transitivity
of the traversals:

    @@QUERY
    traverse(@"#uogbuji", set(o:mother, o:father))
    @@

returns a similar result to that of:

    @"#uogbuji" - set(o:mother, o:father) -> *

The traverse function takes a set of subjects and predicates to be matched
in the model.  The objects of all statements matching one of the given
subjects and predicates are returned.

Result:

    @@EXPECTED
    <Set>
      <Resource>#mogbuji</Resource>
      <Resource>#logbuji</Resource>
    </Set>
    @@


And I can now find all ancestors by setting the transitivity flag:

    @@QUERY
    traverse(@"#uogbuji", set(o:mother, o:father), vtrav:forward, vtrav:transitive)
    @@

Result:

Of course, Osita Ogbuji has a richer set of ancestors according to my model:

    @@QUERY
    traverse(@"#oogbuji", set(o:mother, o:father), vtrav:forward, vtrav:transitive)
    @@

###Lesson 25


I can also traverse the inverses of properties (similar to backward
traversals).  To find the children of Linus Ogbuji:

    @@QUERY
    traverse(@"#logbuji", o:father, vtrav:inverse)
    @@

Note that I just traverse o:father, since I know in this case o:mother
is otiose

Result:

    @@EXPECTED
    <Set>
      <Resource>#cogbuji</Resource>
      <Resource>#uogbuji</Resource>
    </Set>
    @@

And to find all his descendants:

    @@QUERY
    traverse(@"#logbuji", set(o:mother, o:father), vtrav:inverse, vtrav:transitive)
    @@

Note that I restored o:mother, even though it's still otiose.  This would
have been required if Linus or any of his children had daughters who
in turn had any children.

Result:

    @@EXPECTED

###Lesson 26


So far I have always known exactly what properties I want to use in querying
This won't always be the case.  You can always find all properties expressed
on a given resource easily enough:

    @@QUERY
    properties(@"#uogbuji")
    @@

Result:

    @@EXPECTED
    <Set>

    @@


And I can just get the values of all properties of Uche ogbuji:

    @@QUERY
    @"#uogbuji" - properties(.) -> *
    @@

    @@EXPECTED

      <Resource>#logbuji</Resource>
    </List>
    @@


###Lesson 27

Again, if I execute a simple "all() query on the model, I get all
resources, including predicates:

    <List>
      <Resource>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type</Resource>
      <Resource>http://rdfinference.org/ril/eg/family/age</Resource>

      <Resource>#lstubblefield</Resource>
      <Resource>http://rdfinference.org/ril/eg/family/fname</Resource>
    </List>


If I want to to narrow it down to
only those resources that are subjects of some whatement, I can
combine a forward filter expression with the properties function:

    @@QUERY
    all() |- properties() -> *
    @@

Result:

Hmm.  Perhaps this is not quite what I want.  I get one copy of
each resource for each of its properties.  One way to fix this is to
convert the resulting list to a set, which will eliminate the duplicates
(and destroy any ordering).
