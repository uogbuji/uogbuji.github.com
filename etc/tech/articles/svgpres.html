     <img align="left" width="40" height="29"
    src="images/W.gif" alt="W"/>ith the huge
    success of XML, a lot of speculation has arisen as to which
    XML-related technology was the real killer app waiting in the
    wings. As many experts will point out, XML is just syntax. Tim
    Bray, one of the fathers of XML, loves to note that XML is
    boring. The true magic of XML lies not in the basic syntax but
    in the many attendant standards that emerge as syntactical
    issues become effectively commoditized.</p>

    <p>So what's the XML killer app? I'd say there have been four
    major contenders for that title, each of which has received a
    lot of hype: XSLT, RDF, XLink, and SVG. Scalable Vector
    Graphics (SVG) is probably the least known of those
    technologies, but it may be the one most likely to make a
    splash in the world beyond data geeks. SVG is a 2-D vector
    graphics format entirely encoded in XML. It's a candidate
    recommendation of the W3C, which means it's pretty close to
    final, or recommendation, status.</p>

    <p>Some readers might be violently wagging their heads. In a <a
    href="xmledi.html">
    previous <em>Sunworld</em> article</a>, I gave an example of
    how bloated a sample purchase order became when converted from
    EDI to XML (over 10 times). XML formats tend to be more
    verbose. Why on earth would anyone use XML in such a typically
    byte-frugal area as graphical format?</p>

    <p>It turns out that the W3C SVG Working Group (WG) has put a
    heroic effort into making SVG 100 percent XML, fully functional
    for vector graphics, and still compact. In fact, SVG
    representations of a given graphic are often only a modest
    increase over their equivalent in other vector formats and are
    typically much smaller than raster formats for images suited to
    vector display. Given its compactness and ease of processing,
    it might at first seem to be an apples-to-oranges comparison,
    but some have wondered whether SVG could or should supplant
    Java's Swing GUI.</p>

    <p>Enough hype. Let me show you SVG so you can form your own
    opinion.</p>

    <p><font size="+1"><strong>Introduction to
    SVG</strong></font><br />
    SVG's feature set includes nested transformations, clipping
    paths, alpha masks, raster filter effects, template objects and
    extensibility (it's XML, right?). SVG also supports animation,
    zooming and panning views, a wide variety of graphic
    primitives, grouping, scripting, hyperlinks, structured
    metadata, a specialized Document Object Model (DOM), and easy
    embedding in other XML documents. SVG supersedes PGML and VML,
    two earlier XML-based vector formats that spawned the political
    battles that fueled SVG's development.</p>

    <p>Listing 1 is a small SVG sample illustrating the use of
    several SVG features.</p>

    <p><strong>Listing 1</strong></p>

&lt;/svg&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Note that I put together the listing by hand (with help in
    some areas because I'm not a gold-medal geometrist). I've
    included generous amounts of white space to give the listing a
    friendlier look. In most cases, SVG will be generated either by
    artists using tools, such as Adobe Illustrator, or by
    software-generating automated images, such as maps from raw
    data. In either case, the resulting SVG will likely be
    condensed to save space and not be very readable. Of course,
    that is the beauty of the XML basis: if you do get one of those
    dense files, you can use just about any DOM library to read and
    print it. You can even edit the SVG source directly, using one
    of the many specialized XML editors.</p>

    <p>The example includes the optional but highly encouraged XML
    declaration and uses the SVG Document Type Definition (DTD)
    given in the spec. Both can be eliminated for space, but
    remember that if you omit the document type, it can't be
    validated by the XML parser. Next comes the svg element: the
    mandatory root element. The height and width attributes are
    self-explanatory. The viewBox attribute means that after
    logical rendering according to the natural size of each object,
    the entire image will be stretched (or shrunk) to take up a
    particular size, in this case 800 by 800 pixels. Like most
    vector graphics systems, SVG supports a flexible set of
    coordinate systems and measurement units.</p>

    <p>The <code>desc</code> provides a description or title for
    the image, and it is highly recommended by the spec.</p>

    <p>The following element illustrates one of the huge advantages
    SVG reaps by building on the wide variety of Web and XML
    technologies. Many stylistic features of graphics objects can
    be customized using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and other
    stylistic systems. Building on that established technology
    facilitates learning, implementing, and using SVG, and improves
    its integration into current presentation systems. As usual for
    CSS, one can place style attributes directly on the target
    element, or one can define named global styles (with cascading
    features available for fine-grained control).</p>

    <p>In this example, I define three named styles in the style
    element. Note the departure from XML to CSS syntax in the
    element's body. That presents an obstacle to SVG manipulation
    with XML tools. Using CSS is one of the trade-offs the SVG
    group had to make between XML format, compactness, and
    technology reuse. We shall soon see even more startling
    compromises between those goals.</p>

    <p>Next, we have our first graphics primitive: an ellipse. The
    rx and ry attributes establish the ellipse's bounding box, and
    you can see a style defined for the ellipse: it will be drawn
    in yellow with a pen 10 pixels wide and then filled in with
    brown. Finally, the entire object has a transform applied,
    moving it 500 pixels right and 200 pixels down.</p>

    <p>Then we define a polygon. The points attribute defines the
    points that connect the straight lines of each segment of the
    polygon. Here is another place where the CSS WG made the
    controversial but understandable decision to cram a lot of
    structured data into a single attribute, which is usually a
    poor practice. Breaking each point into a separate attribute
    wouldn't work because they must be in sequence, and XML
    attributes have no defined sequence. Using subelements would
    have meant tremendous bloat, both in SVG files and in the DOM
    representation created by SV manipulation tools.</p>

    <p>The polygon, like the rest of the objects I create, uses a
    class attribute to adopt one of the named styles. The polygon
    uses a slightly more involved transform that moves and rotates
    it 45 degrees around the center of the entire image.</p>

    <p>Then there's an example of text rendering. The text element
    again uses a named style specifying font face and point size.
    The x and y attributes indicate the origin of the bounding box
    of the rendered text.</p>

    <p>Finally, there's a path, a free-form curve. That curve can
    be specified in multiple connected segments, each using a mix
    of techniques from straight lines to bezier curves. If you look
    very closely, you'll see that the right end of the path is
    clipped a bit by the overall image boundary (in the svg
    element).</p>

    <p>Figure 1 is an example of that, using CSIRO's SVG viewer. I
    used CSIRO's Java-based viewer because it gave me the least
    trouble in Linux. I also tried IBM's SVGViewer from their
    Alphaworks project but found it buggy and lacking several SVG
    features. I wrestled with GNOME's CVS repository for a while,
    that being the only way to get Ralph Levien's SVG Viewer, Gill.
    Unfortunately, GNOME seems to have suffered a CVS meltdown for
    a few days: I couldn't get in through anonymous CVS or through
    any of its online repository tools (bonsai or LXR). That's too
    bad because I saw a demo of Gill last year, and it promised to
    be the fastest SVG viewer on Linux. Rendering my image changes
    using CSIRO was a trying experience: it usually took five
    seconds or so to render my very simple file on a PII 366.
    Windows users are luckier: Adobe's SVG viewer is quite fast and
    very complete.</p>

    Sun's SVG Slide Toolkit is a resource for authoring
    presentations. It allows users to write their presentations in
    a very simple XML-based format and generate a slick
    presentation, using SVG. SVG potentially gives presentations
    the same capabilities as Microsoft Powerpoint: style, images,
    animations, multimedia. Sun's toolkit provides basic functions
    as is, and uses the power of XSLT to allow the user to extend
    the presentation with all of SVG's abilities.</p>

    &lt;/slide&gt;

    &lt;slide id="III.2"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Quote Them on it&lt;/title&gt;

        &lt;para&gt;"Over twenty organizations, including Sun Microsystems, Adobe, Apple, IBM, and Kodak, have been involved in defining SVG."&lt;emphasis role="note"&gt; -- Vincent J. Hardy, Sun&lt;/emphasis&gt;&lt;/para&gt;

        &lt;para&gt;"I have been working with computer graphics for
over 25 years and spilt an immense amount of blood on the floor at
midnight. With SVG I can now do almost anything I want [except for 3-D, in
which I also have a molecular interest]. And I suspect that I can stick
with it for the foreseeable future." &lt;emphasis role="note"&gt;-- Peter Murray-Rust, XML-DEV Founder&lt;/emphasis&gt;&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;para&gt;"I envision a day where we have XHTML Webpages with SVG as the chrome of our interfaces -- defining the buttons, the layers, the coloring, and the grid -- where we can actually use a language that's XML-based rather than these separate GIF files that can take so long to download. That's certainly one vision; that vision not just extending on the Web, on a monitor, but wireless onto my PalmPilot or to print and other output as well." &lt;emphasis role="note"&gt;-- Steve Mulder, Razorfish&lt;/emphasis&gt;&lt;/para&gt;

    &lt;/slide&gt;

&lt;/slideset&gt; 

&lt;/slideshow&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Note that a full doctype is specified, once again optional.
    The <code>slides.dtd</code> is provided by Sun to define the
    slide format it uses. Unfortunately, that is the only
    documentation users have to go by, so I illustrate the most
    important elements in my example above. Sun also provides a
    sample presentation source file.</p>

    <p>The slideshow element represents the entire presentation,
    which is generated as a single (sometimes quite large) SVG
    file. It starts with an optional title for the entire
    presentation, and follows with an optional metadata element
    providing information about the speaker and occasion of the
    presentation. The core of the presentation is in one or more
    slideset children, each of which represents a subsection of the
    presentation.</p>

    <p>Each slideset has its own title and set of slide elements,
    each of which is a single panel. Note that Sun's SVG
    presentations are designed to take up 1024 by 768 pixels. That
    can be changed, but only with significant effort. The slide
    element allows the user to specify the traditional bullet
    items, images, and links, with a range of style options
    available for highlights and formatting. Each slide has an ID
    that can be used as an internal reference in the presentation;
    I'll use it as a guide as we take a closer look at our
    example.</p>

    <p>Slide I.1 shows the basics. It has a slide title and a
    series of plain items. It also has a speaker's note not
    rendered into the final SVG. The third item illustrates
    emphasis, which is rendered as a color change.</p>

    <p>Slide II.1 demonstrates headings and places items within a
    bullet list, which renders each item with a leading graphic.
    There are also flat lists and numbered lists.</p>

    <p>Slide II.2 renders SVG source code into the presentation.
    It's our earlier example, modified to fit into the generated
    presentation. As you can see, I've moved the graphics around,
    resized some things, and changed the text style to print in
    white so that it shows up against the default black background
    of the presentation. The source code is enclosed, naturally, in
    a CDATA section so it can be rendered verbatim. It is placed in
    a preformatted tag, supposedly to leave the formatting as
    is.</p>

    <p>That <em>supposedly</em> points to one of the biggest
    problem areas in Sun's toolkit: poor support for block-level
    structures. Block-level structures are those that can encompass
    several physical display lines and are formatted accordingly.
    Many presentation elements, including preformatted, only make
    sense as block-level elements, and are indeed indicated as such
    in Sun's DTD. Yet the toolkit uses in-line styling to render
    such elements, so they're displayed in one long line.</p>

    <p>A work-around for now, one that Sun uses in its own
    presentation example, is enclosing each line of the desired
    output in a separate formatting tag. So, for instance, each
    line in the SVG listing in slide II.2 would be enclosed in its
    own preformatted tag. However, that is not only tedious but
    antithetical to the most fundamental ideas behind XML and
    reusable style.</p>

    <p>The right answer is to fix the stylesheet. Unfortunately, I
    found after some fiddling that the straightforward fix didn't
    seem to have the expected effect, and it might just be that Sun
    was dealing with problems in Adobe's SVG viewer (the
    recommended one, and the only one I found capable of handling
    the resulting presentations).</p>

    <p>Slide II.3 renders the actual SVG image into the
    presentation. The graphic element establishes a specialized
    link that instructs the SVG viewer to display the graphic
    in-line. Other graphic formats such as PNG and JPEG can be used
    as well.</p>

    <p>Slide III.1 shows some quotes in paragraph form.
    Attributions are highlighted with emphasis. Note the role
    attribute on the emphasis element. That is used to specify
    different types of emphasis. Sun's toolkit doesn't yet render
    different types of emphasis differently, and the valid role
    attributes in the given DTD are rather limited. That is
    probably an area Sun is still working on.</p>

    <p>Also note that the contents of the paraelement suffer from
    the block-level element problem I mentioned earlier, and they
    are unfortunately rendered in a single line. In all three of
    the quotes, the line goes off the edge of the presentation area
    and, because Adobe's viewer lacks scroll bars, information is
    lost. The work-around (hacking the quotes into multiple
    paraelements) is too horrid to contemplate, and hopefully that
    bug will be addressed soon.</p>

    <p>Figure 2 illustrates what the presentation looks like while
    on slide II.3, the one that incorporates the sample SVG image.
    Next I'll explain how I got from Listing 2 to Figure 2.</p>

    <p><font size="+1"><strong>Working the
    machinery</strong></font><br />
    Now for the fun part: making this stuff happen on your
    computer. Several hoops and gotchas exist for now, so I'll try
    to walk you through it all. As SVG adoption spreads and the
    technology matures, I fully expect the process for SVG
    presentation (and the millions of other SVG application
    opportunities) to become much smoother.</p>

    <p>First, get the software you need. Links for all downloads
    are given in the Resources section. Sun's SVG Slide Toolkit
    came as <code>svgslidetool.zip</code>. You need a fully
    compliant XSLT 1.0 processor to work the toolkit and, believe
    me, the SVG toolkit is a very thorough test of XSLT 1.0
    compliance. Sun tested using XT and Saxon. I used 4Suite, which
    I codevelop (version 0.9.1 or greater is required). Finally,
    you need an SVG viewer to see the resulting presentation. Sun
    recommends Adobe's SVG viewer, which is fine except for one
    thing: it only runs on Windows. I tried IBM's SVGView, CSIRO's
    SVG toolkit, and Ralph Levien's Gill, none of which even came
    close to properly rendering the SVG Sun's toolkit emits. I
    don't suppose there's much chance of a Unix port from
    Adobe.</p>

    <p>For now, install Adobe's SVG viewer on the Windows box on
    which you'll be viewing the presentation. Then install 4Suite
    (or other XSLT processor of choice) on the box you'll be using.
    Unzip <code>svgslidetool</code>. It has several files in the
    created <code>SVGslides</code> directory and more in
    <code>SVGslides/images</code>. It also has an all-but-useless
    <code>README.html</code>. Start with our example
    presentation.</p>

    <p>Listing 2 has an image link, <code>sample.svg</code>. You
    can make this file by copying from Listing 3.</p>

    <p><strong>Listing 3</strong></p>

    <p>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC
    "-//W3C//DTD SVG 20000802//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20000802/DTD/svg-20000802.dtd"
    &gt; &lt;svg width="400" height="600"&gt; &lt;desc&gt;SVG
    Sample for Presentation&lt;/desc&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt; .Lagos { fill: white; stroke:
    green; stroke-width: 16 } .ViaAppia { fill: none; stroke:
    black; stroke-width: 8 } .OrthoLogos { font-size: 32;
    font-family: helvetica; fill:white } &lt;/style&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;ellipse transform="translate(100 75)" rx="50" ry="100"
    style="fill: brown; stroke: yellow; stroke-width: 3"/&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;polygon transform="translate(200 -250) rotate(45)"
    class="Lagos" points="350,75 379,161 469,161 397,215 423,301
    350,250 277, 301 303,215 231,161 321,161"/&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;text class="OrthoLogos" x="0" y="250"&gt;TO
    KALON&lt;/text&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;path class="ViaAppia" d="M100,200 C100,100 250,100
    250,200 S400,300 400,200"/&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; </p>

    <p>Copy Listing 2 to a file called <code>listing2.xml</code>.
    Then copy Listing 3 to <code>sample.svg</code>. You can place
    those two files right into the <code>SVGslides</code>
    directory, or you can copy <code>SVGslides/slides.dtd,
    SVGslides/svgslides.xsl, SVGslides/svgslides_custom.xsl</code>
    to the same directory as <code>listing1.xml</code> or whatever
    presentation you happen to be building.</p>

    <p>Now use the XSLT processor to apply the toolkit:</p>
<pre>
[uogbuji@borgia SVGslides]$ 4xslt listing2.xml svgslides.xsl &gt; test.svg
</pre>

    <p>That runs the 4XSLT processor with <code>listing2.xml</code>
    as sources and <code>svgslides.xsl</code> as stylesheet. The
    output is redirected to <code>test.svg</code>, which has the
    entire presentation in SVG form.</p>

    <p>To display that in Adobe's SVG viewer, copy the generated
    <code>test.svg</code> and <code>slides.css</code> into a
    directory on the Windows machine and use Netscape Navigator or
    Internet Explorer to browse the svg file. That should launch
    Adobe's viewer if it has been properly installed.</p>

    <p>These are the files needed for building the presentation
    files:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The source file</li>

      <li>SVG images referenced by the source file</li>

      <li><code>svgslides.xsl</code></li>

      <li><code>svgslides_custom.xsl</code></li>

      <li><code>slides.dtd</code> (if your XSLT processor will try
      to validate)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are the files needed for viewing the presentation
    files:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The generated SVG presentation file</li>

      <li><code>slides.css</code></li>

      <li>Non-SVG images referenced by the source file</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The above dependency lists are the main detail to remember
    when using Sun's toolkit. If you omit any while building the
    presentation, you'll get errors from your XSLT engine. If you
    omit any referenced SVG images, they will be silently ignored.
    If you omit any files while building the presentation, Adobe's
    SVG viewer will hang with a message in the status bar saying
    <em>Retrieving Referenced Files...</em></p>

    <p>Note that in the examples that come with Sun's SVG toolkit,
    all the referenced images are placed in an images directory. Be
    careful that the relative directory structure remains the same
    from building to viewing if you do things that way. I found it
    easier just to keep all the needed files in the same
    directory.</p>

    <p>One final note: Sun touts its SVG slide toolkit as being
    customizable. I think that is an overstatement. True, you can
    tweak most presentation appearance and behavior facilities by
    modifying <code>SVGslides/svgslides_custom.xsl</code>, but that
    is such a complex beast that you might as well write your own
    stylesheet from scratch. Customization is one area where Sun
    might make a real difference in making the toolkit a Powerpoint
    killer.</p>

    <p><font size="+1"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font><br />
    SVG is a marvelous technology. It must be mentioned that its
    proponents (myself included) should be careful not to turn it
    into the overhyped technology of the week. Its main
    revolutionary claim is to take a well-trodden problem space
    (vector graphics) and craft a solution that works with the rest
    of the XML universe. That sounds simple, but many sharks lurk
    in those waters, and the SVG WG did a tremendous job.</p>

    <p>Sun's SVG Slide Toolkit is a neat application of SVG's XML
    integration. It uses XML, SVG, XSLT, CSS, and XLink to turn
    very simple slide specifications into slick-looking slides that
    gain potential extensibility and power from SVG.
    <em>Potential</em> is the key word. The toolkit is a usable
    solution, but glitches and complex use and deployment mean that
    the user experience is much less friendly than the standard
    established by traditional presentation programs. That is not
    in itself a bad thing: the toolkit is definitely aimed at power
    users. But to make power users happy, it will have to make
    customization a straightforward task.</p>

    <p>Because SVG viewers are still emerging, even the modest goal
    of providing sophisticated slides to Unix users isn't met
    because only Adobe's SVG viewer for Windows can handle the
    output.</p>

    <p>However, Sun's toolkit is still useful for basic
    presentations and is a nice learning tool for SVG. It also
    packs a significant <em>wow</em> factor as a demonstration of
    XML. I definitely recommend you give it a try for your next
    presentation if you have an extra hour to experiment. <img
