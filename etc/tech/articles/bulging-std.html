<h1>Battle of the Bulging Standards</h1>

<div class="storybody">
  
  <p>
The many people and organizations who came to the XML industry from 
the database and software development industries have always wanted 
better standards for modeling the native data structures they 
interchange in XML. Some support for this was always likely in 
developing the XML Schema language that was expected to supplant XML 
1.0 DTDs. Yet when drafts of the W3C XML Schema language (WXS) 
emerged, the mechanism provided for integrating with data type 
support proved immediately controversial.
</p><p>
	To simplify the matter a bit, the Post Schema Validation 
Infoset (PSVI) annotates the Infoset of an XML document (i.e., the 
abstract model of its nodes) with information about the types that 
became associated with each node during schema processing. The many 
people who came to XML from the document and text management space, 
and even from the Web architecture space, objected to this imposition 
of programming types into XML at such a fundamental level. The main 
fear was that this would end up causing a lot of complexity in other 
XML technologies even if people didn't use XML as a mere data 
serialization format.
</p><p>
	The introduction of the PSVI is one of the reasons that so 
much interest persisted in alternate schema languages. RELAX and 
TREX, which merged to form RELAX NG, limited themselves to validating 
documents. RELAX NG allows one to assign data types from plug-in 
libraries to simple element content and attribute values, but it 
doesn't provide a model of any sort for these types. Such a model 
would have to be layered upon the process that does the validation. 
This difference has led to a palpable split in the XML community 
between those who can't imagine XML without built-in provisions for 
data typing and those who can't imagine why such things shouldn't be 
layered very distinctly from XML's textual core. Furthermore, one 
camp sees data typing as needed for XML tools, while the other 
worries that the added complexity will make XML impossible to process 
without sophisticated (and thus expensive) tools. The open source 
versus commercial software battle thus enters into the mix.
</p><p>
	There is actually more to the choice between RELAX NG and WXS 
than data typing: RELAX NG has gained unexpected momentum largely 
because it's a much earlier tool for modeling common XML constructs. 
However, the debate between XML-as-pure-text and 
XML-as-serialized-data has become more prominent as the PSVI wends 
itself into other specifications. The emerging new battlefield is the 
W3C XML Query language and its effect on the next iterations of XPath 
and XSLT.
</p><p>
	XPath and XSLT are arguably the most successful XML-related 
technologies besides XML 1.0 itself - and they're relatively simple, 
providing ways of addressing the nodes that make up XML documents 
pretty much as they are after basic parsing. Some facilities, such as 
the sum() function in XPath and <xsl:sort> in XSLT, do provide for 
superimposing operations based on data types, but these are 
lightweight. Users who take to WXS and thus end up using its 
sophisticated
data-typing system, including such things as dates and floating-point 
numbers, wish for more tools for manipulating these in XPath and XSLT.
</xsl:sort></p><p>
	The XML Query working group early on recorded a requirement 
for support of WXS types. XQuery modeled itself as a sort of 
supercharged extension of XPath node access and XSLT result 
templates, and eventually the W3C decided to pool the effort toward 
XQuery 1.0, XPath 2.0, and XSLT 2.0. The result of all this was that 
next-generation XPath and XSLT drafts became much more complex as 
they included all manner of facilities for PSVI and data types.
</p><p>
	People in the XML-as-text camp, who at first simply wrote off 
XQuery as a byzantine curiosity that they needn't worry about, 
suddenly found their beloved XPath and XSLT transformed into exactly 
the kinds of specifications they feared the PSVI would inspire.
</p><p>
	The result of all this right now is a pitched battle between 
the text and data types camps, with XQuery held up as the model for 
all that is supposedly good or bad about the directions in which XML 
is moving. XQuery itself has been undergoing changes to try to 
accommodate all the competing concerns. And comments on most of XML's 
public mailing lists, including that of the W3C technical 
architecture group, intimate that a showdown may be in the offing as 
the drafts in question progress toward recommendation.
</p><p>
	XML technology has brought together an impressive diversity 
of practitioners. Now a debate between the two prominent branches is 
destined to shape its future.
