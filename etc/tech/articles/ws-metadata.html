Powering Web Services Through Metadata
</p>

<p class="subtitle">
How RDF could help Web Services standards
</p>

<p class="articlebyline">Uche Ogbuji</p>

<p class="intro">
One of the most important requirements for highly automated Web
Services is a rich description mechanism. In order to narrow down the
negotiation and discovery of services that fit a particular contractual
and technical profile, this information needs to be made available in
an accessible way for machine processing. There have been several
initiatives to develop systems for encoding and querying such Web
Service descriptions, among them the Web Services Description Language
(WSDL) and Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI). </p>

<p class="body">
These data formats define a vocabulary for service descriptions,
automation, rules, and processing, and perhaps the quickest route
towards practical implementation of Web Services is to take advantage
of RDF: the W3C's system for managing such vocabularies. This paper
discusses how to use RDF for rapid implementation of Web Services based
on the emerging standards such as WSDL, UDDI, and ebXML.
</p>


<p class="heading">
Introduction 
</p>

<p class="body">Web Services are just part of the evolution of
component development technology. The two key aspects of component
systems are the ability to plug in required software functions from
heterogeneous bits of code, and the ability to invoke these functions
across platform, network, language, and other such boundaries. It has
long been recognized that metadata is one of the most important aspects
of components systems. Developments such as interface registries from
COM, and interface repositories and meta-object facilities from the OMG
are considered essential to component reuse and management.
</p>

<p class="body">Web Services bring component technologies to the Web,
with HTTP transport and XML-formatted payloads. Metadata is just as
important for Web Services as it is for other component systems. This
is clear enough by the great attention already lavished upon UDDI in
these early stages, but as they were developing system for representing
structured and semi-structured data in XML, the W3C also came up with a
system for managing structured and semi-structured metadata: Resource
Description Framework (RDF). Due to its simplicity and usefulness with
XML, RDF has steadily increased in adoption, and currently there is no
reason for it not to be considered as a metadata management facility
for Web Services. </p>

<p class="body">
RDF itself is not introduced in this paper, but several resources are cited, which provide the necessary background. 
</p>

<p class="heading">
Motivating RDF for Web Services 
</p>

<p class="body">
First of all, let us consider the basics of Web Services discovery and
description. Once a vendor implements a service and wishes to make it
available for remote use, the first order of business is to describe
the service. The important elements of the description of the service
include: </p>

<ul>
<li>
vendor identifier
</li>

<li>
prose description
</li>

<li>
internet address for messages
</li>

<li>
format of request and response messages
</li>

<li>
cost
</li>

<li>
service contract
</li>
</ul>

<p class="body">
Some of these description items are simple values, such as the vendor
ID and the prose description. Some of them are probably references to
distinct documents, either machine readable, such as the message
formats, which might be in the form of an XML schema (or DTD,
Schematron, RELAX, TREX, Examplotron, etc), or human readable, such as
the service contract. One way to view this collection of data is
illustrated in the diagram below.
</p>

<img alt="Web Service metadata model" src="images/ogbuji01_01.gif" height="249" width="550">

<p class="body">In the fictional Web Service illustrated above, the
vendor, W. S. Money, Ltd. offers a current exchange rate query service
for 50 cents (US) per transaction. The service can be accessed by
sending an HTTP request to the web server at <a class="linkification-ext" href="http://ex-rate.money.ws/" title="Linkification: http://ex-rate.money.ws">http://ex-rate.money.ws</a> on port 8001. The XML schema for the HTTP message to be sent to this server can be downloaded from <a class="linkification-ext" href="http://ex-rate.money.ws/schema" title="Linkification: http://ex-rate.money.ws/schema">http://ex-rate.money.ws/schema</a>, and the service contract to which all customers must agree can be downloaded from <a class="linkification-ext" href="http://ex-rate.money.ws/contract" title="Linkification: http://ex-rate.money.ws/contract">http://ex-rate.money.ws/contract</a>. 
</p>


<p class="body">
These facts are expressed in the diagram by labeled arcs from a central
circle. This central circle is a resource representing the abstract Web
Service. The end-points of the arcs indicate the objects of the facts.
They could be literal strings (represented by rectangles); for
instance, the fact that the 'vendor' of the abstract Web Service is
given by the string 'W.S. Money, Ltd.'. Or they could be other abstract
or retrievable resources (represented by ovals); for instance, the fact
that the 'message schema' of the Web Service is a resource located at
the URL <a class="linkification-ext" href="http://ex-rate.money.ws/schema" title="Linkification: http://ex-rate.money.ws/schema">http://ex-rate.money.ws/schema</a>,
which, when downloaded happens to start with the string '&lt;!ELEMENT
foo', which you might recognize as the beginning of an XML document
type definition (DTD).
</p>


<p class="body">The typical group of descriptions, shown above,
demonstrate why there's a role
for RDF definitions. RDF allows the architect to formally define the
various nodes and arcs in the above diagram in a standard way. Since
RDF relies on uniform resource identifiers (URIs) for resource
identity, the message schema and contract fit naturally into an RDF
form, in order to be managed naturally by RDF and Web Services tools.
</p>

<p class="heading">
Working with WSDL, UDDI, ebXML, etc. 
</p>

<p class="body">You will, of course, recognize from the example above
all the elements of description. These are all, in various form,
elements of WSDL, UDDI, and ebXML registry/repository (reg-rep). Of
course, rather than using RDF, these Web Services specifications use
specialized XML formats to represent the description. Currently vendors
are working to develop query and management tools for Web Services
descriptions based on these customized formats, but there are many RDF
tools for management and query of RDF-based metadata already available
(see the section entitled 'Resources' at the end of the article). </p>

<p class="body">
Another reason for using RDF to augment WSDL, UDDI, and ebXML is
resource management. One of the differences between the basic
description example presented above, and the practice of Web Services
formats such as WSDL, UDDI, ebXML is that the latter make some effort
to pack human and machine readable documents right alongside the other
description elements. This can be problematic when managing both
distinct human and machine-readable documents.
</p>

<p class="body">In the case of human-readable documents there is no
substitute for having humans, and in particular legal counsel,
attendant at every stage of service negotiation. Practically, there is
a long way to go before automatic negotiation is a sensible option, and
the best approach to Web Services discovery is to have agents collate
and filter the available information, in preparation for human
decision-makers.
</p>

<p class="body">In the case of machine-readable documentation such as
schemas, modularity is often an important part of high-quality software
design of such systems and embedding interfaces with other metadata has
the danger of minimizing reuse and manageability. Schemas should be
discrete, first-class documents that can be accessed by separate
systems with a guarantee of integrity. </p>

<p class="body">
It is currently possible to take advantage of RDF for these very
reasons. The 'Resources' section beneath points to articles and
presentations, which include examples, sample transforms and schemas
for conversion from WSDL, UDDI, and ebXML models to RDF. Because of
RDF's highly flexible facilities for XML serialization, most such
conversions are almost trivial. WSDL expressed in RDF looks almost
exactly like WSDL in its original format. There is also an effort
underway to expand and formalize such conversions, in particular the
RDF/Web Services mailing list. This would make it easy to continue to
exchange information using Web Services formats but manage the
information using basic RDF and XML databases. </p>

<p class="body">
Available RDF tools include schema design tools, diagramming tools,
efficient search and query, inference engines, and even basic language
tools such as terminology dictionaries and word classification systems
(which can act as dictionaries and thesauruses). Using RDF, it is
already feasible to ensure that someone looking for a 'monetary
conversion rate' Web Service would successfully find W.S. Money's
exchange rate service. </p>

<p class="heading">
Conclusion 
</p>

<p class="body">
So why didn't the main Web Services efforts use RDF? My personal
experience in discussions with creators of Web Services specifications
is that most were completely unaware of RDF. Most do seem to agree with
its value as long as exchange is possible using Web Services XML
formats. Certainly there is a great deal of activity, much of which
brings together core XML and RDF, and the Web Services that can build
on these. The W3C, which developed RDF and has put it to work in areas
including privacy preferences and content ratings, has devoted some
activity to Web Services. </p>

<p class="body">
Web Services developers looking for proven tools for rapid deployment
of their systems should consider issues of metadata management in
general, and should in particular consider RDF for management of Web
Services metadata. </p>
