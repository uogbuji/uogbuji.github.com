I'm a poet, essayist and editor. Though my degree is in electrical and computer engineering, my true passion is literature, and poetry in particular. I'd have striven towards a writing career if my parents hadn't compelled me with the usual parental sense to secure a more economically assured profession first.  I'm lucky enough to engage in literary projects purely for pleasure, though it can be hard to scrape up time for them.

      <h2>Manna and the maxim gun</h2>
      <p class="source">
        <cite>Unsplendid,</cite> January, 2012</p>
      <pre>Herod paid for peace in blood,
Quite careful it was not his own.
The red cap chiefs stack up their wealth,
Shards of what once was bred in bone.

Church tales of wandering accursed—
It's forty years full fifty times;
Malaria did scurvy work
Until quinine did work of limes.

Champagne powder, I lip-smack
Fatback...

      <h2>Love ascended between us &amp; Folly between us</h2>
      <h3>Two poems: A translation and a looser adaptation of “El Amor Ascendía Entre Nosotros,” by Miguel Hernandez</h3>
      <p class="source">
        <cite>String Poet,</cite> December, 2011</p>
      <pre>Desire flooded limbs restrained,
Overwhelmed our grasping senses,
Left us vulnerable to stroke,
And dumb to use the orb as dish
To serve each tasty other.

      <h2>Devil's Backbone &amp; Word Wounds in Time</h2>
      <h3>Two poems</h3>
      <p class="source">
        <cite>IthacaLit,</cite> September, 2011</p>
      <pre>A moment that started with the friendly
Wave of every day evolved into
Tsunami of the sidewalk as you fled.
Space exploded so fast your neighbors left
Their hellos, goodbyes, their sorries, thank yous,
Water cooler yarns and lame jokes behind;
Buried with each the scraps the other said,
Lost between comma and exclamation.
What brush hand daubed those seconds in dread?

      <h2>Fortune of Chi</h2>
      <p class="source">
        <cite>Soundzine,</cite> August, 2011</p>
      <pre>Some randomized permutation of genes
Spelled these very left and right brain cortices—
Spotlight nerves on sheer possibility;
Some Mendel melody conjured these eyes,
These muscles, grafted these veins under this skin;
I am too many pin-point faults to be
By design yet I crown my own life's fitness:
I am perfected fortune of my chi.

      <h2>Demoiselle</h2>
      <p class="source">
        <cite>Corium Magazine,</cite> June, 2010</p>
      <pre>Every bush has its berry
With soft fingers and a long tongue,
Slow, wide open like a Sunday afternoon.
But she doesn't fool me,
Alcohol all on her breath
Like a ghost in the window
Of an abandoned house.
Her hips don't tell my hands like yours.
You're a soul flame.

      <h2>Growing Up Misfit</h2>
      <p class="source">
        <cite>The Nervous Breakdown,</cite> March, 2010</p>
      <pre>When your eyes learn to look beyond state,
          to peers beyond infinity,
Okigbo, Villon, Pound, Plath, sometimes
          you forget that misfit can grow to vanity.
I've come to grow into readiness for company,
          the scent and crinkled space of shared humanity.

Collage is completion from gestalt-spackled gaps,
          pieces that never fit, that itch.
These rub away their corners into the circle
          of the whole.  They don't match,
They mate; their seed elaborates the daisy chain,
          fit and unfit bait and switch.</pre>
