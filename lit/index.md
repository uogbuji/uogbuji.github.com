I'm a poet, essayist and editor. Though my degree is in electrical and computer engineering, my true passion is literature, and poetry in particular. I'd have striven towards a writing career if my parents hadn't compelled me with the usual parental sense to secure a more economically assured profession first.  I'm lucky enough to engage in literary projects purely for pleasure, though it can be hard to scrape up time for them.

        <cite>Atavic Poetry,</cite> October, 2013</p>
        <p>Where does one go in a black-lash mood<br/>But to a mountain town teahouse.<br/>He’d planned to use its walls to break his fist;<br/>He’d flung himself upon the ground—<br/>Somehow he’d missed.<br/>        <br/>

        <p>Que tiene amigo? Léon! Hermoso es!<br/>We all know that poem, that plaint for frost-face,<br/>Done in by poachers mad for yellow pelt;<br/>We teach it to our children in our schools,<br/>Spread wide along the Front Range<br/>And flung in pockets of the moneyed belt<br/>Where diamond mountain life buzzes against<br/>Gold flecks exposed as elder snows melt.<br/>        <br/>

      <p class="source">
        <cite>The Nervous Breakdown,</cite> March, 2010</p>
        <p>When your eyes learn to look beyond state,<br/>          to peers beyond infinity,<br/>Okigbo, Villon, Pound, Plath, sometimes<br/>          you forget that misfit can grow to vanity.<br/>I've come to grow into readiness for company,<br/>          the scent and crinkled space of shared humanity.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>Collage is completion from gestalt-spackled gaps,<br/>          pieces that never fit, that itch.<br/>These rub away their corners into the circle<br/>          of the whole.  They don't match,<br/>They mate; their seed elaborates the daisy chain,<br/>          fit and unfit bait and switch.<br/>
