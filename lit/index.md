I'm a poet, essayist and editor. Though my degree is in electrical and computer engineering, my true passion is literature, and poetry in particular. I'd have striven towards a writing career if my parents hadn't compelled me with the usual parental sense to secure a more economically assured profession first.  I'm lucky enough to engage in literary projects purely for pleasure, though it can be hard to scrape up time for them.

      <p class="source">
        <cite>Scree,</cite> April, 2012</p>
        <p>I'd also forgotten—what crackling recall!—<br/>The many shades of mango flesh,<br/>The many textures of mango flesh,<br/>The tumescences of varied fruit,<br/>Sacred arrays upon seasonal trays,<br/>Indiscreet colors ablush, all orange,<br/>Formulae told at the tongue, all sweet.<br/>        <br/>

        <cite>Unsplendid,</cite> January, 2012</p>
        <p>Herod paid for peace in blood,<br/>Quite careful it was not his own.<br/>The red cap chiefs stack up their wealth,<br/>Shards of what once was bred in bone.<br/>

        <cite>String Poet,</cite> December, 2011</p>
        <p>Desire flooded limbs restrained,<br/>Overwhelmed our grasping senses,<br/>Left us vulnerable to stroke,<br/>And dumb to use the orb as dish<br/>To serve each tasty other.<br/>

      <h3>Two poems</h3>
      <p class="source">
        <cite>IthacaLit,</cite> September, 2011</p>
        <p>A moment that started with the friendly<br/>Wave of every day evolved into<br/>Tsunami of the sidewalk as you fled.<br/>Space exploded so fast your neighbors left<br/>Their hellos, goodbyes, their sorries, thank yous,<br/>Water cooler yarns and lame jokes behind;<br/>Buried with each the scraps the other said,<br/>Lost between comma and exclamation.<br/>What brush hand daubed those seconds in dread?<br/>

      <h2>Fortune of Chi</h2>
      <p class="source">
        <cite>Soundzine,</cite> August, 2011</p>
        <p>Some randomized permutation of genes<br/>Spelled these very left and right brain cortices—<br/>Spotlight nerves on sheer possibility;<br/>Some Mendel melody conjured these eyes,<br/>These muscles, grafted these veins under this skin;<br/>I am too many pin-point faults to be<br/>By design yet I crown my own life's fitness:<br/>I am perfected fortune of my chi.<br/>

      <p class="source">
        <cite>Corium Magazine,</cite> June, 2010</p>
        <p>Every bush has its berry<br/>With soft fingers and a long tongue,<br/>Slow, wide open like a Sunday afternoon.<br/>But she doesn't fool me,<br/>Alcohol all on her breath<br/>Like a ghost in the window<br/>Of an abandoned house.<br/>Her hips don't tell my hands like yours.<br/>You're a soul flame.<br/>

      <h2>Growing Up Misfit</h2>
      <p class="source">
        <cite>The Nervous Breakdown,</cite> March, 2010</p>
        <p>When your eyes learn to look beyond state,<br/>          to peers beyond infinity,<br/>Okigbo, Villon, Pound, Plath, sometimes<br/>          you forget that misfit can grow to vanity.<br/>I've come to grow into readiness for company,<br/>          the scent and crinkled space of shared humanity.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>Collage is completion from gestalt-spackled gaps,<br/>          pieces that never fit, that itch.<br/>These rub away their corners into the circle<br/>          of the whole.  They don't match,<br/>They mate; their seed elaborates the daisy chain,<br/>          fit and unfit bait and switch.<br/>
