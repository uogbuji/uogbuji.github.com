<title>Uche Ogbuji: RDF: metadata for the Web</title>

Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a system for representing metadata for
the Web. That is, it is a way of expressing the attributes relationships that
help computers make sense of data on the Web. I first discovered RDF in 1999
and have co-developed an RDF implementation, and the specification and
implementation of Versa, an RDF query language, among other efforts.
