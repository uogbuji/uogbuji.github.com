Basically, just follow along

versa-quick-start.txt

If you want to try things out for yourself, you'll need to get 4Suite until other processors that support Versa are available.

* Make sure you have Python 2.0 or more recent (http://python.org)

* Get a 4Suite CVS snapshot dated after February 18th from

ftp://ftp.fourthought.com/pub/cvs-snapshots/

Unpack it, then install using "python setup.py install"

* Or get the 4Suite HEAD from anonymous CVS at cvs.4suite.org

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.4suite.org:/var/local/cvsroot login

[just hit enter at the [Password prompt]

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.4suite.org:/var/local/cvsroot co 4Suite

Then "python setup.py install"


The 4versa script will be in your Python library directory (or in a subdirectory of that called "site-packages", as Ft/Share/Bin/4versa

For example, on my machine, 

/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/Ft/Share/Bin/4versa
