[Igbo](http://igbopeople.blogspot.com/2009/03/uche-ogbuji.html)-American immigrant from Nigeria, settled near Boulder, Colorado with my wife, three sons and daughter. Restless mind in a restless body, I do a million things without getting very much truly done, but most notably in two areas.

* [As a poet and editor](/lit)
* [As a computer engineer, entrepreneur and technology educator](/tech)

Oh yeah, and also as a classicist Africanist *cum* Hip-hopper, traveler, language lover, snowboarder, martial artist, soccer player, and of course [Gooner](http://www.arsenal.com/home).
