_**Ńchéfù Road**_ is my first full-length book of poems. "Ńchéfù" is Igbo for forgetting, misplacement. These are poems of a child born in the age of decolonization, and specifically in the very aftermath of the sort of destructive civil war colonial exploitation made inevitable. These are poems of a child who was raised through a whirlwind of global travel, led by his parents in search of a future for their family. The poet eventually came to realize he must first forgive himself his muddled identity before the great rivers of his bloodline will forgive him his estrangement. The book [won the Christopher Smart Prize in the UK](https://store.eyewearpublishing.com/blogs/news/mel-pryors-judging-report-for-the-smart-prize).

Available from your favorite bookseller (ISBN-13: 978-1-913606-93-0), from [the publisher, in the UK & Ireland](https://blackspringpressgroup.com/products/nchefu-road), or [signed copies directly from me](/etc/lit/OrderingNchefuRoad.pdf).
