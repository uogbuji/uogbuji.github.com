![Ndewo, Colorado](/img/NdewoColoradoPlate.jpg)

I'm excited to announce my collection of poetry, Ndewo, Colorado ([Kelsay Books](http://kelsaybooks.com/), due in November, 2013). You might as well just listen to me tell you about it, and of course that way learn about the meaning and pronunciation.

Some of the poems in this book have already been published elsewhere, so enjoy this preview I've compiled.

      <p class="stanza">The woman and child in bathing suits<br>
Trudge, plough, step high over dunes,<br>
Crunch ice for footing in measured stride.<br>
Turning about, they leap on the saucer and fly<br>
Merrily down pitted slopes into raptures,<br>
Finding their break against banking snow&hellip;

Sky with their gnomic, craggy brown.<br>
<i>Settled deep into Colorado's legend.</i><br>
I look out from this million year old crown.&hellip;

Firm as pine roots, supple as tulips.&hellip;

Shape up to yell &ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo;<br>
The leavings of trees whip through the breeze<br>
And garnish the crumbs we strew;<br>
Away rats: &ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo;&hellip;

We all know that poem, that plaint for frost-face,<br>
Done in by poachers mad for yellow pelt;<br>
We teach it to our children in our schools,<br>
Spread wide along the Front Range<br>
And flung in pockets of the moneyed belt<br>
Where diamond mountain life buzzes against<br>
Gold flecks exposed as elder snows melt.&hellip;

By what Cheyenne would call the pale-suited guide,<br>
Squint past bark beetles engaged in arborcide,<br>
Past insulted, host lodgepole whose shoots heighten<br>
The kite-eye perspective, the skied sense<br>
From green to pale green, from blue to pale blue,&hellip;

Blowing to whip wind to mist-shifting brisk.<br>
