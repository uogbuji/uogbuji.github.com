The story is made of the spark off the end of the flame.

* summary: Never once thinking I’d be the sort to go
Half on a life-long voyage on the whole,
Romance seemed to me a shadow of cirrus at sunset,
All the rest of my occupations waxing red;

Discovering quickly the fight was under fate’s fix.

* summary: Granite broods immune to optic laws—
Dulled light and memory sink into its lows
And play its crusted deeps to sterner grey
Leaving remnant gloom to ever grow
Through such despair marked near infinity
By legion souls whose every vanity
Of hope or justice crumbled under boot.

* author: uogbuji
* summary: It's as if that vengeful god has called;
He's up the sky soon to be burst with terrors
That serve us right for existential crime;
Not satisfied with nasty, brutish, short,
He's fashioned out a fathomless device
And rigged it to the doomsday clock's last chime.
They sing: 'God gave Noah the rainbow sign,
Warning: No more water, but fire next time!'

Where diamond mountain life buzzes against
Gold flecks exposed as elder snows melt.

* summary: I was alone, but my hand took on my mother’s,
Hovering over the pot with a command gesture,
Smothering all thought inessential to the task,
All distractions from the essences I’d ranged:
Cinnamon, cardamom, and then, snake-charmed
From coriander, cumin and turmeric
I swelled to the stove, which sprang wormhole
To Chengdu, to Tehran, to Kabul and Lhasa,
And over the möbius loop to Lomé, Yaoundé and Calabar.

By what Cheyenne would call the pale-suited guide,
Squint past bark beetles engaged in arborcide,

The kite-eye perspective, the skied sense
From green to pale green, from blue to pale blue,
And ash and ash we've smudged where they meet from this view;

As since these days of missing you
Have brought me sunset less its tinge
Of fire, a darkened vault above
Without its twinklers; creeping through
My mind a hush, recalling love.

* summary: Demeter twirls a barley stalk and laughs with Ala
Next to her, between whose knees rest Kore's head.
Even in this time whose custom grants Ala's fingers
Rest from blackening soil for her toiling votaries
She works a hostess courtesy in virgin tuber oil
Into cornrows she has wrought of Kore's hair.

Robed in your color, which is life, in your form, which is beauty
I grew in your shade; sweetness of your hands swathed my eyes
And there at the summer day zenith, I discovered you, Promised Land, in heights of a scorched, lofty pass
And your beauty blasts me, full-hearted, like lightning flash of an eagle.

That dead rictus purloined from the mourning,
Refuses truth to those whose loving hands
Press malaria from your heaving bosom;
We call you from abyss, calm! we insist.

The many shades of mango flesh,

The tumescences of varied fruit,
Sacred arrays upon seasonal trays,
Indiscreet colors ablush, all orange,
Formulae told at the tongue, all sweet.

Quite careful it was not his own.
The red cap chiefs stack up their wealth,
Shards of what once was bred in bone.
Church tales of wandering accursed—
It's forty years full fifty times;
Malaria did scurvy work
Until quinine did work of limes.

* summary: A moment that started with the friendly
Wave of every day evolved into
Tsunami of the sidewalk as you fled.
Space exploded so fast your neighbors left
Their hellos, goodbyes, their sorries, thank yous,
Water cooler yarns and lame jokes behind;
Buried with each the scraps the other said,
Lost between comma and exclamation.
What brush hand daubed those seconds in dread?

* summary: Your smile loops to a cursive ell—
We've all learned its complexity—
Your lush hair springs up from the scene,
Great mushroom cloud of ecstasy.
An uprock cyclone sweeps the room
With Style Wars on the parlor screen;
We dodge the rainbow shot of toys
Propelled by legs in floor routine.

Hot venom as the scorpion bows
To cantor de Ronsard.

Spelled these very left and right brain cortices—
Spotlight nerves on sheer possibility;

These muscles, grafted these veins under this skin;
I am too many pin-point faults to be
By design yet I crown my own life's fitness:
I am perfected fortune of my chi.

“So who d'you think you are,” they howl
“To seal your bonnet from the bee?”
Those bouncers at the Muses' hill
Take down attendance in their hall—
You're conscript to the gathering
To rouse the skaldic clan again
With clinking roar of brannigan.
Yield bruckle skin to miching flea.

With soft fingers and a long tongue,
Slow, wide open like a Sunday afternoon.

Alcohol all on her breath

Of an abandoned house.
Her hips don't tell my hands like yours.
You're a soul flame.

    * title: The Nervous Breakdown
* summary: When your eyes learn to look beyond state,
          to peers beyond infinity,
Okigbo, Villon, Pound, Plath, sometimes
          you forget that misfit can grow to vanity.
I've come to grow into readiness for company,
          the scent and crinkled space of shared humanity.
Collage is completion from gestalt-spackled gaps,
          pieces that never fit, that itch.
These rub away their corners into the circle
          of the whole.  They don't match,
They mate; their seed elaborates the daisy chain,
          fit and unfit bait and switch.
