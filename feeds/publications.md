* summary: AI is more than pattern recognition. It can also build on patterns to generate expression. This is increasingly important in the world of intelligent agents. Learn about generative AI, an important class of techniques to the modern developer. As a first step, consider the patterns in natural language and how these can be modeled to prepare machines to generate their own expressions of familiar language. Discover how to go from basic letter frequency statistics to correlation between letters by using matrix-based models.

* summary: Gain a sound understanding of the crucial role of data in the development of artificial intelligence and cognitive applications, and how this importance has developed throughout the history of AI, though not always explicitly acknowledged. Learn how the quality and quantity of available data can make all the difference in pattern analysis and training. AI is experiencing a resurgence on the web, but the understanding that a good data corpus is the lifeblood of any AI is not widespread. Learn to avoid the enormous danger from AI doing more harm than good if problems of bias and statistical skew propagate from the data corpus. Gain an edge in developing successful AI applications by understanding the role of data in various AI techniques, and the characteristics of data sets that support those techniques.

* summary: In response to libraries’ frustration over their rich resources being invisible on the web, Zepheira, at the request of the Library of Congress, created BIBFRAME, a bibliographic metadata framework for cataloging. The model replaces MARC records with linked data, promoting resource visibility through a rich network of links. In place of formal taxonomies, a small but extensible vocabulary streamlines metadata efforts. Rather than using a unique bibliographic record to describe one item, BIBFRAME draws on the Dublin Core and the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) to generate formalized descriptions of Work, Instance, Authority and Annotation as well as associations between items. Zepheira trains librarians to transform MARC records to BIBFRAME resources and adapt the vocabulary for specialized needs, while subject matter experts and technical experts manage content, site design and usability. With a different approach toward data modeling and metadata, previously invisible resources gain visibility through linking.

* summary: MicroXML is a simplification of XML that is compatible with earlier versions. Part 1 of this two-article series covers the basic principles of MicroXML. MicroXML is designed with a straightforward grammar that can be processed with many modern general-purpose parsing tools. James Clark, who led the original push for MicroXML, is among those thinkers who developed a parser for the community specification. Learn how to use Clark's JavaScript MicroXML parser to experiment with the format.

* summary: Parts of the XML community always grumble that XML is difficult to understand and process. XML is fundamentally complex for various historical reasons, and people proposed simplified versions for more than a decade. JSON and HTML5 threaten some of the most basic XML tenets. MicroXML — a simplification of XML that is compatible with earlier versions — emerged from discussions of these issues. MicroXML is now under the guidance of a W3C community group, and several basic implementations are already available for the draft specification. In this first article of a two-part series, learn from one of the MicroXML Community Group cochairs about MicroXML and its technical differences from the XML 1.x core standards.

* summary: Data is the lifeblood of the enterprise, and the best way to prepare for a development and integration project is to document the characteristics of the data that drive the target applications. Learn the key questions that an enterprise data architect should explore in order to effectively document the characteristics of relevant data and take the most important first step towards project success.
