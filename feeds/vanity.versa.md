* summary: 'Today, it is hard to imagine developing a new application without using a DBMS. Uche Ogbuji, Enterprise Data Architect, Engineer and Entrepreneur writes “Anyone looking for a good flame war can always drop into any software development forum and casually ask what database software should be used for the next project, or even ask whether he or she needs to bother with a relational database. Because databases technologies are such an important part of programmer philosophy, it is hard to find objective discussion for the hapless developer looking for a good, general-purpose database management system (DBMS) to use in a project.”  Ogbuji’s IBM developerWorks article “Choosing a Database Management System” is 15 years old but the ideas still ring true today.

* summary: "The book of poetry penned by Uche Ogbuji that won a 2014 Colorado Book Award is titled Ndewo, Colorado. That name should give you some idea of the gorgeous contradictions between its covers, poetry that pays homage equally to landscape and scientific concepts, penned by a computer engineer and immigrant to Colorado by way of Nigeria (and several other countries). We recently sat down with Ogbuji to talk about poetry, travel, inspiration and how he distills complex science into descriptive prose."

* summary: A new category for poetry chapbook was introduced this year, allowing for a smaller sub-category of poetry to gain some well-deserved exposure. This year’s winner is Uche Ogbuji with his chapbook collection “Ndewo Colorado.” Ogbuji’s collection is written in the point of view of a Nigerian raised immigrant who eventually settles in Colorado. Ogbuji has taken the liberty of inventing his own form called the dialette. His experimentation with form and language are both challenging and fascinating.
