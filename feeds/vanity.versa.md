* summary: "Regionalism worked in the Eastern region, producing distinguished pace setters for Nigeria, most of whom Nigeria denied the self-set goals of making Nigeria a giant of Africa and a model new world country that would successfully compare with the developed nations. Some of the success stories of Regional Federalism in Nigeria are Prof. Kenneth Dike, first Nigerian V.C of University of Ibadan, Prof. Eni Njoku, first Nigerian V. C of University of Lagos, Prof. Chike Obi, first Nigerian professor of Mathematics, Prof. Austin Esogbue, first black professor at Georgia Institute of Technology, Prof. Linus Ogbuji whose applied mineralogy expertise assisted NASA in bringing back to Orbit, the Astronaut vessel that went into flames in 1986. There are thousands more; there just is not enough space to list them here."

* author: http://quicksipreviews.blogspot.com/p/about-me.html
* summary: '“Remote Witness” by Uche Ogbuji¶This poem, like the last, also evokes periods of history and movement, but it’s a bit more explicit in its speculative focus, imagining technology that allow people to go back in time, that allow the main character of the poem to take something of a tour of history, only for things to not be quite so sterile as expected. The idea of a historical research tour is, after all, one that seems like it would be dry, almost boring. The endeavor here has a much different flavor, because the weight of the past hits the main character of the poem with such a force.'

Uche Ogbuji, Enterprise Data Architect, Engineer and Entrepreneur writes “Anyone looking for a good flame war can always drop into any software development forum and casually ask what database software should be used for the next project, or even ask whether he or she needs to bother with a relational database. Because databases technologies are such an important part of programmer philosophy, it is hard to find objective discussion for the hapless developer looking for a good, general-purpose database management system (DBMS) to use in a project.”  Ogbuji’s IBM developerWorks article “Choosing a Database Management System” is 15 years old but the ideas still ring true today.

That name should give you some idea of the gorgeous contradictions between its covers, poetry that pays homage equally to landscape and scientific concepts, penned by a computer engineer and immigrant to Colorado by way of Nigeria (and several other countries). We recently sat down with Ogbuji to talk about poetry, travel, inspiration and how he distills complex science into descriptive prose."

* summary: A new category for poetry chapbook was introduced this year, allowing for a smaller sub-category of poetry to gain some well-deserved exposure. This year’s winner is Uche Ogbuji with his chapbook collection “Ndewo Colorado.” Ogbuji’s collection is written in the point of view of a Nigerian raised immigrant who eventually settles in Colorado. Ogbuji has taken the liberty of inventing his own form called the dialette. His experimentation with form and language are both challenging and fascinating.
