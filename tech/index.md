I'm a founder and Chief Technology Officer at [Zepheira](http://zepheira.com/), where I specialize in packaging and processing information to make it effective on the Web. A lot of our recent work has been for libraries and related institutions and we've just announced an exciting initiative to revitalize libraries: [Libhub](http://libhub.org).

I've done a lot of pioneering work in data on the Web, including around XML, Semantic technology, web services and collaborative platforms. I've contributed many open source projects, and I write a lot of articles at technical journals such as IBM's, Intel's and O'Reilly's. This makes for a bit of cross-over with my work in [literature](/lit).

I was educated as an engineer (Electronics Engineering [in Nigeria](http://www.unn.edu.ng/) and Electrical/Computer Engineering [in the US](http://www.msoe.edu)) but after a short stint in embedded systems design I've been in general-purpose computing all my career.
