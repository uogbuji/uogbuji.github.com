<title>Uche Ogbuji: Python: programming for the discriminating adult</title>

[Python][41] is my favorite general-purpose programming language. In fact, I
don't think I've seen a better language for the general purpose, though others
may be better in particular niches. I ran into Python soon after discovering
Red Hat and suffering a traceback in one of their Tk GUI tools. I was able to
debug the problem, even though I had never seen this language before, and I
was instantly hooked. Coming from my literary background, I value highly
Python's readability, and even more the richness of expression it allows. 

I've long tried to contribute to Python as I could. Two keys ways have been in
writing extensively on Python topics (see below), and in working on Python's
XML capabilities. I am active on the [Python XML SIG][42]. I am an elected
member of the [Python Software Foundation][43]. Fourthought is a member of the
[Python Business Forum][44].
