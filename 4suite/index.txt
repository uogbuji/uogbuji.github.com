<title>Uche Ogbuji: 4Suite: Platform for XML and RDF processing</title>
<![CDATA[
[4Suite](http://4suite.org) is an open-source platform for XML and RDF development. It allows users to take advantage of standard XML technologies rapidly and to develop and integrate Web-based applications. It comprises three separate packages:

* 4Suite XML - XML, XPath, XSLT, related technologies and support libraries
* 4Suite RDF - RDF processing libraries and stand-alone DBMS
* 4Suite Repository - XML and RDF repository

This is a release of only the first component.

[4Suite XML](http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/4Suite-XML) is a comprehensive library for XML processing.  It's implemented in Python and C and supports XML (SAX-like and DOM-like),
XPath, XSLT, RELAX NG, XUpdate, XInclude, XPointer, and more.

<!--
4Suite is primarily developed by my company, [Fourthought, Inc.][45] [Contact us][46] for priority support and customizations.--> For free support (no guarantees), join, then post to the [4Suite mailing list][47]. Other resources include [The 4Suite Wiki](http://notes.4suite.org) and the [4Suite IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/4suite) (#4suite on irc.freenode.net).

## Consider Amara

If your main need is just basic XML processing in Python, consider using [Amara XML Toolkit](amara/).  EasyInstall makes it easy to install 4Suite and Amara in one go.  See [The Amara wiki](http://notes.4suite.org/AmaraXmlToolkit) for more info.

<!--
## Official docs

I host local copies of the official 4Suite docs as a convenience to users. If you are new to 4Suite, I suggest following these documents in order, choosing between the first three according to your platform, and whether you want to use the most recent CVS version.

[Installing 4Suite from CVS][50]

[The Windows install doc][51]

[The UNIX install doc][52]

[The 4Suite XML user manual](/tech/4suite/etc/CoreManual.html)

[4XSLT paper \[PDF] \[in Dutch]](/tech/pubs/4xslt.pdf). I am hosting, a paper on the use and architecture of 4XSLT, in dutch, for Davy Friedrich, Joe Achten, and Wim Deprez, who wrote it as a student paper.

Utility scripts to manage namespace mapping files for user convenience. Namespace mappings files can be used with many 4Suite RDF tools to set prefixes a user can employ in abbreviating URIs, much like in the RDF/XML syntax. [create-nsmapping-file.py][65] establishes a mapping file for the user who invokes it. [add-nsmapping-file.py][66] adds a prefix/namespace URI pair to the mapping.

## Other Resources

Questions on 4Suite? First stop is the official [FAQ](http://4suite.org/docs/FAQ.xml), then the <a href="http://notes.4suite.org/4SuiteFaq">Community FAQ</a>. If you can't find your answers check the [mailing archives](http://lists.fourthought.com/pipermail/4suite/) of the 4Suite list or post to that list. Or drop by IRC (see above).  Several 4Suite developers are usually on-line on the channel, but be prepared to maybe wait a few hours for response, as we may be away from the computer.

People interested in participating in or closely following the development process of 4Suite can join the [mailing list for core 4Suite developers](http://lists.fourthought.com/mailman/listinfo/4suite-dev), which is open (as are its [archives](http://lists.fourthought.com/pipermail/4suite/)).

<!--
You can try an [on-line, forms-based on-line XSLT transformation demo][61] using 4Suite and the [CherryPy app server][62]. Also shows rendering of HTML results.

SENRI Hiroshi has translated [some of the 4Suite docs to Japanese][63].

## Relationship to PyXML

PyXML is now a retired project

[by Mike Brown, I think] 4Suite versions through 0.11.1 were essentially add-ons to specific versions of PyXML. Newer versions of 4Suite can utilize xmlproc, the validating parser that comes with PyXML, but in general, PyXML is no longer a prerequisite for 4Suite.

Stable versions of 4Suite's XPath and XSLT processing modules are occasionally folded back into the PyXML distribution, but this tracking has been temporarily suspended until the 4Suite 1.0 release arrives and stabilizes. In PyXML, the xml.xpath and xml.xslt modules are currently (as of PyXML 0.6.6 to 0.8.2) equivalent to those that came with 4Suite 0.10.2, plus some necessary patches. Many folks use these PyXML modules without complaint, but the modules are known to be buggy and slow, compared to the Ft.Xml.XPath and Ft.Xml.Xslt modules in current releases of 4Suite. They also are not compatible with the newer 4Suite releases, so for people needing both 4Suite and PyXML, it is recommended that when PyXML is installed, that setup.py be run with the - -without-xpath and - -without-xslt options, preventing xml.xpath and xml.xslt from being installed at all.
-->

## Odds and ends

4ODS is no longer maintained, but for convenience, here is the rather sparse user guide for 4ODS in [HTML][72] and [Docbook source][73]. For the real scoop, see the [ODMG 3.0 book][74], which was pretty strictly our implementation guide.
